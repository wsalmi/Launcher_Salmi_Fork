## How to Install
* Use the Flasher: [Launcher Flasher](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/).
* Use M5Burner, or
* Download the .bin file from Releases for your device and use https://web.esphome.io/ or esptool.py and flash the file: `Launcher-{ver}-{YourDevice}.bin` into your device.

## How to Use
* Turn your Device on
* Press M5 (Enter) in the Launcher Start Screen to start Launcher
* Choose OTA to install new binaries from M5Burner repo
* After installed, when turn on the device, if you don't press anything, the installed program will be launched.

## My SD Card doesn't work!
* Make sure your SD is a SDHC (Not SDXC)
* Maximum size of 32Gb (I use 8 or 16Gb)
* Formatted in FAT32 (Use [Rufus tool](https://rufus.ie/) to format your SD Card)

  <summary><h3>Tips</h3></summary>
* Having an SD card is good for better experience, but not really needed. [SDCard Hat for M5StickCs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069)
* You can learn more about how it works o [Launcher Wiki](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Explaining-the-project).
* Where/How do I find Binaries to launch -> [Obtaining binaries to launch](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Obtaining-binaries-to-launch)
* Now you can download binaries from [HERE!](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/m5lurner.html)
</details>

## Known Issues
* UiFlow 1 doesn´t work with Launcher.. it uses an old MicroPython distro, that uses an old ESP-IDF distro with lots os secrets that I couldn´t figure out.

## To-Do list
Things that needs to be done in next updates
     * [ ] LVGL for e-paper displays
     * [x] Move to ESP-IDF Platform (In Progress - v2.7.x)
          * [x] Created ESP-IDF compatibility layer (components/esp_idf_compat/)
          * [x] Migrated serialCommands to pure ESP-IDF as proof-of-concept
          * [x] Set up hybrid Arduino/ESP-IDF build system
          * [x] Documentation: [ESP_IDF_MIGRATION.md](ESP_IDF_MIGRATION.md)
          * [ ] Phase 1: Migrate isolated components (partitioner, settings, powerSave)
          * [ ] Phase 2: Migrate networking (WiFi, webInterface)
          * [ ] Phase 3: Migrate core modules (main, keyboard, massStorage)
          * [ ] Phase 4: Migrate display system (v3.0.0 target)
